Assignment 4 - Page
Replacement Algorithms
Objectives:
1. Implementing several page replacement algorithms.
2. Evaluating several page replacement algorithms.
Problem Statement:
It is required to simulate some paging replacement algorithms. The required algorithms
to be implemented are as follows:
Optimal
First In First Out (FIFO)
Least Recently Used (LRU)
Clock
Assignment 4 - Page Replacement Algorithms
1Input/Output:
Your input will be from standard input. Your output will be to standard output. The input
will contain the number of pages allocated to the process, the simulated algorithm
(OPTIMAL, FIFO, LRU, or CLOCK), and then a sequence of page references like
below:
3
FIFO
5
12
5
2
4
2
5
......
1-
Note: The last line in the input is -1 (and is ignored)
For each run, you should print the following:
1. A trace recording page faults for each memory reference in the sequence.
2. Counter recording total page faults.
We will have the following results (notice the two-digit page numbers):
Replacement Policy = FIFO

Number of page faults = 2 

Notes:
You must write your solution in C/C++.
Operating System: Linux
Your input and output must follow the described format strictly. Your program will
be automatically graded.
Complete source code commented thoroughly and clearly.
You should work individually.
Check the academic integrity policy of the course.
Deliverables:
Complete source code in ONE FILE
Name your file as your ID (e.g., 5237.c, 5237.cpp, 5237.C, 5237.cc, ...)
Your source program will be compiled, then will be tested by running the following
command, which should produce nothing in case of a successful test:
gcc <ID>.c -o lab4
cat inputfile | ./lab4 | diff outputfile -
